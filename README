Last.fm from SVN
================
Last updated: 22-October-2007

Windows
-------
You need to run qmake before opening LastFM.sln.
You'll need the DirectSound SDK, and some other stuff.

OS X
----
You need to run qmake before opening Last.fm.xcodeproj.
You'll need to install XCode, even if you use a different editor.

Linux
-----
Open LastFM.kdevelop or run: qmake && make.
You'll need libfftw, libmad, taglib and asoundlib.

To compile you need to install the Qt4 development packages and development
packages for all the above packages. If you don't know what this means, you may
want to beg someone from your distro to package Last.fm for you. We don't 
support build problems due to lack of know how as we just don't have the man 
power! We do support compile errors though.


Troubleshooting
===============
Complain at the forum:

    http://www.last.fm/forum/

Or you can email me <max@last.fm>


Building Packages
=================
You can run the scripts in dist from this directory.
Please note, these scripts are not supported outside the company because
frankly, we hardly understand them either.
