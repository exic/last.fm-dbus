-=Last.fm DBus extension=-

This is an extension to the Last.fm client that allows you to
control the client's behavior over DBus.  The interfaces follow
the 1.0 version of the MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing
Specification).  Last.fm will become accessible on your
session bus at "org.mpris.lastfm" with objects "/", "/Player" and
"/TrackList".  It's worth noting that as a streaming music player,
Last.fm doesn't support all the optional features of MPRIS,
such as seeking, going back, etc.  But the features supported are
correctly reported in the MPRIS GetCaps (Capabilities) function.

First thing to note: Qt is only compiled with DBus support
on unix systems!  If you're not running a unix-based system
(I'm unsure if OSX qualifies here), don't expect this 
extension to work!

This README was updated for version 2.0 of the plugin, which
adds support for MPRIS 1.0.


Installing
----------

Get and unpack the Last.fm application source code.

Place the "dbus" folder in the src/extensions folder of the application

Enter the dbus folder and execute "qmake dbusextension.pro; make".
You're not actually building the whole lastfm app, you just need
some headers to build the extension.

If all goes well, you will have a "libext_dbusextension.so" in your 
bin/extensions folder

Copy this file to the extensions folder where Last.fm is installed.
It should be a subfolder of where Last.fm keeps its support libraries.
(Possibly /usr/lib/lastfm/extensions) If the lastfm folder exists,
but not the extensions folder, you will need to create it.

Run Last.fm

To test, I used the MPRIS tester at
http://www.qt-apps.org/content/show.php/MPRIS+Tester?content=85539
The command-line tools "dbus-send" and "dbus-monitor" are also useful,
as is the graphical tool "qdbusviewer", though that may be quirky.

If the tests don't work, check your ~/.local/share/Last.fm/Last.fm.log
to make sure the plugin is being loaded correctly


If the plugin fails to build
----------------------------

This is probably because the plugin cannot find the libLastFmTools.so
library.  Edit the dbusextension.pro file and find the line that
resembles "LIBS += -L/usr/lib/lastfm".  Make sure this path goes to
the correct location on your system.  Also on my Debian system I had
to force the linker to use the specific file with -l:libLastFmTools.so.1


Other things to worry about
---------------------------

The version of the Last.fm source you build with must be reasonably
close to the version of Last.fm you are running.  I tested by building
against and then running with 1.5.4.26862.
