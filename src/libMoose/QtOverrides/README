Brief
=====
Force this directory first in the -I g++ directives to use these overrides.

With QMake: CXX = $$CXX -IlibMoose/QtOverrides

There is danger with this system. But it beats the system where developers
could accidentally use the Qt version of a class or function and for some
reason it is absolutely essential our override is used.

NOTE, the cpp files are named without the Q as this seems to break qmake, heh :)
