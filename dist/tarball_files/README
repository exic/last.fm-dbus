Last.fm

Firstly, sorry that this doesn't install very well under Linux. There are
patches to prefixify the installation available from our public SVN repository.
But if you build from this default install, it will be a self contained folder
that you can just run from your home directory or something like that.


Requirements
------------
libsamplerate
libfftw
libmad
libgpod
alsa-lib
Qt 4.3


Build
-----
./configure && make


Running the program
-------------------
bin/last.fm.sh


Installation
------------
You can install last.fm to its own prefix, and then copy the last.fm script to
a bin directory in the path, and modify the script so the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
correct.

This isn't tested though. You'd be better doing something like:

    $ mv last.fm-x.x.x.x/bin /opt/last.fm
    $ /opt/last.fm/last.fm.sh


Troubleshooting
---------------
If the configure script or build fails, or the client doesn't work please
complain, vocally and with malice at the client support forum:

Or you can email me <max@last.fm>
